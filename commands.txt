Lec 6 : is about crud operation = update 


// some definations for splice operation
when we want to remove or add elements in middle than we can use splice method
The splice() method adds and/or removes array elements.
The splice() method overwrites the original array.

Ex:
const fruits = ["Banana", "Orange", "Apple", "Mango"];
// At position 2, add "Lemon" and "Kiwi":
fruits.splice(2, 0, "Lemon", "Kiwi");
// opt : banana , Orange , Lemon , Kiwi , Apple , Mango

// At position 2, add "Lemon" and "Kiwi" and overhide apple so remove apple:
fruits.splice(2, 1, "Lemon", "Kiwi");
// opt : banana , Orange , Lemon , Kiwi , Mango


delete by using splice but don't add new elements on it.
