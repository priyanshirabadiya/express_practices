3. Error-handling middleware => To handle errors
app.use((err, req, res, next) => {
  console.error(err.stack)
  res.status(500).send('Something broke!')
})

4. Built-in middleware

I.Static Middleware
To serve static files such as images, CSS files, and JavaScript files, use the express.static built-in middleware function in Express.
app.use(express.static('public'))

Lec - 3 : is about how to use params and query params

To pass data in only in params then 
for that add url like this => http://localhost:1122/age/15
app.use("/age/:age", myFun);

To pass data through query params then
your url will be this => http://localhost:1122?age=58   
you don't need to set it just add data in query params section in postman
needs simple data
app.use("/", myFun);
